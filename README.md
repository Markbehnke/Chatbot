# Chatbot
This is a chatbot application developed in java. The main method can be found at master/Chatbot/src/com/company/Main.java

Most of the code can be found in the Chatbot class which is initialized in the main method.

dialog intent objects for the chatbot can be found in the prompts.json file. Each intent object contains an array of possible user inputted prompts, and a string response to those prompts. 

A major dependency of this project is the json.simple java library. It must be installed before the code can be compiled and run. It was used in other for the chatbot to read the JSON file, parse the JSON file object and catch errors that partain to the handling of the JSON file.
